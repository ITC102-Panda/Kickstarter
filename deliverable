This is great. I think we have a great handle of what we are offering to people who buy in to the campaign. 

Rewards:
1. Offer them inside info and tours of snowboarding trails
2. First looks to try out gear and GoPro their experiences
3. One on one training with a pro snowboarder

Deliverable:
The above are the rewards essentially, but what we should specify is what end we are doing this for. For instance, will the funds pay for a snowboarding tutorial website we will be launching? Or perhaps the funds will go toward preserving/maintainig snowboarding trails?


RE-CAP:

Deliverable:
The a small portion of the money raised will cover the basic expenses we listed, but ultimately the rest of the money will be donated to a to the Snow Days Foundation (http://www.snowdaysfoundation.org/about-us/).

"Snowdays Foundation is a Portland, Oregon based volunteer organization dedicated to youth empowerment through snowboarding. Our program teaches snowboarding to young people.

Our students come from middle and high schools in challenging neighborhoods, with the lowest academic achievement, the highest poverty rates, and the highest percentage of single-parent households."

The participants will be donating to help us create a Kickstarter that will be giving back to an amazing local foundation.
