# Kickstarter

Hey Team!

At the end of class on Wed. Cristina and I briefly discussed changing directions for our Kickstarter campaign. An Adult Coloring book would be fun, but none of us have innate knowledge of what that entails. I suggested we do something regarding Snowboarding. 

I grew up at the base of Mt. Hood in Oregon. I started skiing when I was 2, ski raced from 5-10, started snowboarding at 10, got sponsored by Burton Snowboards and a handful of brands at 16, traveled, competed and filmed till I was 25, then got a job in-house with Burton for 5 years. I know a lot about snowboarding, the subculture, and the mountains in the northwest.

My thought was we could create a Kickstarter where users could come to learn about snowboarding, gear reviews, proper product maintenance, trick tips, insider scoops on secret areas to check out at your local resorts, etc. I know a lot of the local kids here in WA and OR that are doing big things. We could have cameos from local pros and talk to ski patrol for the insider guide to avalanche safety. 

The users/supporters would be paying to learn about all these things. We could also partner with local shops like EVO, Tactics and US Outdoor (I know the buyers, marketing teams and shop kids) and if they kicked in some product (shop apparel, snowboard wax, stickers, etc.) we would promote them as well. This would all be done on a continual video log. There would be two parts to that. 1) would be sitting down in front of the camera/home computer and logging tutorials and updates, and 2) would be filming up at the mountains. We would use GoPros, HitCase’s for your phones, and other low cost equipment to document everything.

The start up cost would need to cover:

- Gas
- Production/Editing time
- Equipment

Please let me know what your thoughts are. I don’t remember the specifics of everything we need to cover, but this is what it says on the syllabus 2/22/16 – The Semantic Web (homework 7 due – design a crowdfunding campaign with an idea, a deliverable, and 3 rewards)

Please submit additions in the Readme.md, let's not over complicate this :)
